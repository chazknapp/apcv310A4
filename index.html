    <h1>Exploring GIS: Mapping Change Through Data</h1>
    <p>This site is designed to bridge the gap for people interested in maps and geography but who have little to no technical GIS experience. 
        It introduces a simple tool that demonstrates how land cover classification works, allowing users to visualize environmental 
        changes over time through an intuitive, interactive platform. By making GIS concepts more accessible, this project aims to show 
        how spatial data can be used to analyze and understand real-world patterns..</p>
