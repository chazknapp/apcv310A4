    <h1>Understanding Land Cover Changes with GIS</h1>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>As I continue learning Python for coding and HTML & CSS for web development, Ive envisioned a project that brings together 
        my passion for GIS and maps while making these tools more accessible to those without a technical background. The goal is to develop a 
        Python-based web application that allows users to explore land cover changes over time through unsupervised classification of raster images.</p>
    
    <p>Users would be guided on how to obtain satellite imagery for two different years and upload the files to the system. The application would then 
        process the images, apply an unsupervised classification, and generate two visual outputs. These classified images would highlight land cover 
        changes, and users would be able to hover over the images to compare differences. Additionally, the system would provide statistical insights on 
        areas of land loss, growth, or stability over time.</p>
    
    <h3>How This Works</h2>
    <p>The platform will include step-by-step instructions on how to obtain satellite data using Earth Explorer, explaining which spectral bands are 
        required and how they contribute to NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) analysis. It will also offer a breakdown of the classification 
        process and how to interpret the statistics, helping users understand land cover changes in a meaningful way.</p>
    
    <h3>Interactive Map Placeholder</h2>
    <p>Since I havent fully developed the classification tool yet, I decided to embed an interactive map as a learning exercise. This serves as a practice 
        step in understanding how to link live maps to a web page and will eventually be replaced by the classification results. Currently, the map is centered on Arkansas, my home state, 
        as a starting point for exploration.

        My long-term goal is to build this project into a user-friendly tool that helps bridge the gap between beginner-level geography understanding and the advanced analytical power of GIS, 
        making geographic research more engaging and accessible.</p>
